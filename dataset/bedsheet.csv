First of all, they are very comfortable, they feel soft but the fabric doesn’t feel slick like some microfiber sheets. I also sleep with a dog and they don’t hold in the smell at all. However there is a noticeable lack of attention to details. After two years of use (not exclusively, other sets of sheets were used in the mix) the elastic on the fitted sheet gave out. There are other little details that miss the mark of quality that other sheets would have. These sheets have loose single stitches that don’t look or feel durable. I was skeptical when I bout them and the name on the amazon ad sounded like a mouthful of cheap infomercial, but the price was right. Bottom line is you get what you pay for and if wuality isn’t a big deal or you’re okay to buy new sheets every few years then these would be great but I’d rather invest in more durable sheets.

The sheets are thin as many reviewers stated so we'll see how they hold up.  They are not well made sheets.  The elastic is not attached to the sheet, it seems like the material was just sewn around it.  Not a big deal but I'm not used to so much independent ""movement"".  Be aware that the picture is misleading (or I am just not as observant as I once was).  The silky accent is on the pillow cases only.  The top sheet just has a plain hem.  These sheets are also not wrinkle free.  They're more like too soft to crease if that makes any sense.  I haven't slept on them yet so I am still hoping to be happy with this purchase.  Oh yes, and the color is not true.  I purchased burgundy but they're closer to red so they clash with my burgundy curtains.<br /><br />I'm going to still keep them as they are not worth the trouble of returning.",3,negative,0,0

I purchased them because I ripped a sheet and needed replacements delivered same-day. They aren't terrible, but they also aren't 4.5 star sheets.

They collect static and, even with frequent washings and fabric softener, often shock me during the night to the extent that I can see the static spark. They bunch up, and don't hug the mattress well. They never look clean on the bed. The pillowcases ride up on my pillows and often I wake up with my head half on the pillow and half on the pillowcase. I've had them for six months and despite only washing once a week with very gentle detergent, they already need to be replaced.

For the price I guess they are alright.<br /><br />I brought the Queen Sized and both the bottom and top sheets don't fit completely over the mattress with the Foam Pad Topper I have. The bottom sheet fits loose causing it to shift while your in the bed. I mean shift so much it's bunched up where ever you were sleeping.<br /><br />I was willing to let that go, just a little more time spent making the bed in the morning.<br /><br />My biggest grip is these sheets shed and pill over everything either they come into contact with, or whatever comes in contact with them. Mattress/Pillow Covers, Blankets, Clothing, you and whatever.<br /><br />I've had these sheets for awhile now and when they go into the wash, using the information found on the care label, all that shedding ends up in the water. You'll see it floating during the cycle  and it doesn't rinse out but rather sticks to the sides of the tub. So I have to wipe the inside and top of the tub down.<br /><br />Once the sheets and pillow cases are off the bed, I now have the mattress/pillow covers to deal with. Some of the color has rubbed off onto them and of course there's the shedding/pilling. So off they go into the wash which invites the same mess that has to be wiped down. These shouldn't need to be washed every week, so I resorted to vacuuming them in between washes.<br /><br />I don't like things that make more work for me, or take a simple task and make it complicated. These sheets turn Wash Day into what already is a long chore into a nightmare.<br /><br />I gave the product 3 stars because they do hold their color well and are still soft after many washings.<br /><br />Good luck",3,negative,0,0

I ordered the cali king set in BEIGE for my new bed. Putting them on was easy enough and the packaging was good--a few out-of-place dark wool lints inside the fitted cover that I mistook in my 3 am paranoia for bugs--but otherwise, everything on that end was okay. Even though I slept on them and didn't have a problem with them once I fell asleep, as an artist, I suppose I find myself thirsting for more aesthetic beauty than what these offer. I'm aware that this is a banal problem to have with a relatively decent product (especially for the price), but indulge me. I was disappointed by the sheen-y cheap motel-esque look, something that's amplified by the color appearing significantly more orange than pictured online. Beige-consumers beware! It's not a white-based beige, it's definitely got an ORANGE cast/undertone.<br /><br />In closing, I appreciate that the sheets are not over-the-top expensive. But I do feel that the ornamentation and thickness of the sheets could be improved. They don't feel very weighty or substantial, but I will overlook this because I live in LA and thin sheets are acceptable in this fiery desert hell. All in all, I'm not sure if I recommend these sheets. If you, too, prefer beauty, then perhaps you may elect to look elsewhere. But if you, too, will yield to a slumber that is wholly forgettable and perfunctory (and most importantly easy on your wallet), then you may elect to look here. As did I.

Amazon had these Mellanni sheets earmarked as Amazon Choice so I looked at them and at the reviews, and decided to try them.  The color is just as seen online....the peach is very bright, but looks nice with my bedroom décor.  As for the quality of these sheets, the are no great but not bad.  Right out of the package, I could see that the stitching on the side seams was in need of repair, so I did that.  After one washing, I had to repair the seams on the pillow cases.  I do a lot of sewing, so this was not a big deal, but it's worth mentioning.  The sheets seem to have permanent wrinkles in them, even though have laundered them as instructed...again, not a bid deal, but worth mentioning.  In comparison to the ClaraCark sheets, they are a bit heavier and softer;  maybe the softness is related to them being ""brushed"". I bought Queen sheets in both Mellanni and ClaraClark and the Queen flat sheet is a little bit wider in the CC brank, which I like.
