B00ZV9RDKK,"on March 7, 2018",amzn1.account.AEOTVLGDO2PBU5E4NIZKH56E55GQ,Worked for 2 months then broke and now crashes my internet.,"Things i liked.<br />1. I was able to watch netflix on my TV. Thats it, i didn't like anything else about it and here's why<br /><br />I was excited at first after only being able to watch netflix on my computer for a couple months, everything was going smoothly and then....i got a notification from my ISP that i have exceeded my monthly cap this made me go ???? As it was the 2nd week into the month and also it was almost impossible to reach that at least for me, i quickly realized it had to be the fire stick sucking up tons of data in the matter of just a few days, i changed some settings dealt with isp and thought that would be it, next thing i know my intetnet is constantly crashing i thought it was my isp throttling me so i lived with it till the new pay month, and when my internet kept crashing i had to look into it. After about a hour i realized that it was the fire stick crashing my net for some reason, i even reset it completely and it STILL crashed it. But when unplugged everything works fine. You get 1 star Amazon this is not a normal thing for me, but i won't be buying anymore amazon tech ever again. To anyone reading this don't waste your money, go buy a roku they are 100x better then this.",1,negative,0,0

B00ZV9RDKK,"on July 31, 2018",amzn1.account.AFOFGARSAJ2IAXM4H6ID7TJ3Q6LQ,Fire TV Stick with Alexa leaves much to be desired!,"My Roku device was getting extremely hot on the living room TV and the sound was terrible, so I moved it to the bedroom (where it is no longer hot and the sound is fabulous - so it must be the TV). However, in moving it, I now wanted a device on the living room TV, and since this was a Prime Day special, I purchased the Amazon Fire stick with Alexa. I had read the reviews and talked with a few people, and thought I was making a great choice. Personally, I will stick to the ROKU - far and away a better device!  And Alexa is an idiot.  I'll keep this because I want a device on the TV in that room and the price was excellent, and it is OK.  I've watched the ""how to"" a few times to see if I can get rid of any of my cons. Nope. Still was not helpful.<br /><br />PROS - if you are a fan of FIRE and Alexa, you will like this. It came in a fancy-schmancy box with an extender, etc. (BTW _ the extender thing is FABULOUS!), It is easy to stick in. It plays a ""how to"" thing (that I found to be lacking, but ok). It looks nice. The back and the batteries are not going to be easily lost or loosed.<br /><br />CONS -  it took me 15 minutes (literally) to prize the back open using a knifeblade to put the batteries in!  I have since tried it three other times, hoping to ""loosen"" the back or figure out how to open it easily, and it still takes 15 minutes!  You get to enjoy (sic) commercials that will NOT go away! The Home is awful - you can't find anything. You have no idea you are going to pay for something until you hit play and then surprise! The menu is worse than awful. The options are not options; they are settings and the settings are very limited. Alexa will not go to the show that I previously watched nor can she find the free version in Prime Video of anything that I want to watch, only the pay for it one; the menu doesn't allow you to search and type in a name, or go back to the show you were watching, either! In fact, I have yet to find a spot that allows you to type in something and actually search. Holding the microphone button while you speak (and hope Alexa will get it), takes as much or more time than typing in the show or picking the show on the ROKU device. My fumble fingers consistently hit the home button (which is NOT in a good location on the stick) instead of the pause or back or forward button when trying to control what I'm watching which sends it back to ""home"" where you can't find anything and Alexa does not understand ""go back to the show I was watching!""  I will stick with ROKU. Much better layout, a far and away better HOME and menu - more ""intuitive"". Unless you are an expert with Alexa, I wouldn't use this stick.  It does what it was made to do; however, it is not something I would recommend and is not as easy to use as the Roku.",2,negative,0,0

B00ZV9RDKK,"on August 5, 2018",amzn1.account.AHT3OE5IN77CEFMWWKCYMVERAD4Q,Warning!  Orders stuff on its own and customer service says no refunds!,"Let me begin by saying I like the Fire Stick for the most part.  Other devices are better, but I have echo dots and I enjoy using Alexa, so the Fire Stick is a natural addition to our media setup.  That being said let me tell you a story...<br /><br />We recently got a Roku Smart TV, and we just placed it in front of our old TV for the moment until we figure out what to do with the old TV.  The old TV has the fire stick attached to it, we didn't switch it over because the new TV has Roku built in.  Today, after about a month of using the New TV, we turn it on and the Old TV comes on too.  They are the same brand so it's not completely surprising.  What is surprising is that Dora the Explorer starts singing at us.  I unplug the old TV and the firestick and think nothing else of it.<br /><br />Until this a little bit later when I get an email saying that we purchased the Dora the Explorer video!  The fire stick remote is sitting up on the fireplace literally gathering dust.  You can tell it hasn't been touched in weeks.  And yet somehow we purchased a video?  So I try to get a refund.<br /><br />I explain what happened to customer service and they act like they are doing me a favor giving me a refund and inform me that there are no refunds on digital products and no refunds in the future.  I explain what happens again and they say I need to set up parental controls... for what?  Is the firestick a child?  If it wants to order videos will parental controls stop it?<br /><br />The customer service rep slips up and says its so my child doesn't order more videos.  I ask if she thinks my child has magic mind control or if she just thinks I am a liar.  I inform her that if my daughter had done my daughter would be getting fussed at not some lady on the phone.  My daughter was playing quietly in her room when everything took place, which is why I was turning the TV on, so I could finally watch something I wanted.  And the firestick remote is literally covered in dust because it literally hasn't been touched in weeks, and when I say literally I mean it literally I'm not being hyperbolic.  The roku remote to the new TV is IR so it should not control the fire stick.<br /><br />Hint, Hint, I'm pointing out a major product flaw, even if it turns out to be a fluke, this could be horrible for the company and needs to be taken seriously!<br /><br />It was only $14, the real problem is that the fire stick purchased stuff seemingly WITHOUT ANY USER INPUT.  That is why I am upset,  that is why I am on the phone with someone instead of enjoying my day.<br /><br />I did end up getting a refund, and after typing this I will be throwing all my fire sticks in the trash.  Yes, multiple, because I own more than one, but what if next time the order is for General Hospital the complete series or something and I'm out $100s instead of $14?  Not worth it.  Customer Service implying I'm a liar makes it even less worth it.<br /><br />Even if it was somehow user error, the fact that a program can be easily ordered without seeing the screen without the remote makes this NOT WORTH IT at any price.  Oops, you sat on the remote?  Congratulations you now own a movie you don't want only $25!  No refunds.<br /><br />Please mark this as helpful or whatever so more people can see it, the last thing I want is for more people to get a nasty surprise.

They come with everything you need - power brick, power cord, HDMI extension - and are basically a plug and play deal.

It is too bad that Amazon and Google can't work something out so that THEIR CUSTOMERS HAVE THE FREEDOM TO PURCHASE the system that works best for them!!  I'm a retired woman of 67 and I've cut the chord of cable TV and use Youtube alot! So, I was pretty upset when Amazon announced they were ending access to Youtube this last year. I took a loss on my Fire Sticks and because of that I decided not to expand to any Amazon technology compatible with Fire Stick like Echo etc.  That is my protest to the greed !  Amazon can WELL AFFORD to do the RIGHT THING AND GIVE ACCESS TO YOU TUBE ON THEIR FIRE STICKS. I've been an Amazon customer for years and this was a big disappointment to say the least. And right now I'm trying to decide whether to cancel my Prime membership as the increase is substantial in my opinion!!  A senior discount would be nice but I doubt that will happen!.

Tried to contact Amazon directly, but too much time has passed. I will be 60 next month, & I'm careful with my electronic equipment. I'm the only person that uses this remote, and maybe only a handful of times a month. Problem is that the primary button (within the circle) is loose, making it difficult to press and control. If this is a common problem, I would be open to suggestions to fix it. If it's not ""fixable"", then it is a flaw in the design, and they should be replaced free of charge.

B00ZV9RDKK,"on March 7, 2018",amzn1.account.AGIHL5Y7FXFIZKCVBUCPLWCJE5QA,I Wanted To Like It....but...,"Here's the thing. I wanted to like the Fire Stick.  I really did.  I was drawn in, like everyone else, by the low price.  Can't be beat.  However, there are certain drawbacks.<br />The first is that the Apps seem to be dropping off Fire TV like flies.  Here are two streaming apps I enjoy: VUDU and Youtube.  Sometime in the last two years Amazon stopped supporting VUDU and the app was discontinued.  Last year Amazon decided not to sell Google products, so as of Jan 1 2018 there is no longer a Youtube app on Amazon Fire TV.  My concern is: What app is next to go?  I don't want to live with that uncertainty.<br /><br />Second,  speed.  The stick itself is very fast.  However, the 1.3GhZ Quad core processor can only handle one app at a time.  So in order to switch between apps it must close the current app and reload the desired app.  It does not have enough RAM to handle multiple apps at once.  This causes delays in usage.<br /><br />Third,  the low amount of RAM causes glitchy/delayed operation.  For example, when it loads a screensaver there is a momentary grey screen.  Sometimes system sound effects do not function consistently. Also, this causes apps and menus to run glitchy and lag from screen to screen.<br /><br />Fourth,  Alexa.  She just isn't very smart.  I believe she is designed that way.  She really only functions well with Amazon content.  But it's actually easier just to use the buttons on the remote than tell Alexa to do it, takes less time.  And when you tell her to do things, such as ""skip 30 seconds"" or play a specific episode, she won't always do it.  Sometimes using these features will even cause the system to glitch/crash. She is very tempermental. Alexa does nothing within any of the other apps besides Prime.  She can simply launch other apps, but she only does it 50% of the time.  The other 50% she doesn't understand you.  And you have to say the exact app name or she won't open it.  For example, to open the CBS app you have to say ""Launch CBS Full Episodes and Movies"" in those exact words or Alexa will not be able to understand what you want. Suffice it to say, Alexa's voice recognition software needs a lot of work. Also, I really don't care if my Fire Stick can order a Pizza or show me movie times.  There are much easier and more efficient ways to do that.<br /><br />Fifth, the controls in streaming apps.  They are all different from app to app.  One will let you seek for rewinding and fast forwarding.  The other will have you scroll through a clumsy thumbnail timeline.  Netflix for example. You are supposed to be able to skip forward and back ten seconds by clicking the left or right buttons.  It even shows a 10 with an arrow pictograph on screen but it doesn't do it.  It just shows the thumbnail timeline screen.  Other apps are similar.  The only app that runs, to any degree, the way it's designed is the Prime App.<br /><br />Sixth, LAN.  The Firestick does not come with a LAN port itself.  If you want a wired connection you must buy a separate LAN adapter from Amazon.  They do not keep them in stock in any great quantity.  So they are often out of stock.  So if you need one in order to get a connection, you may be without streaming for quite some time. As long as a month. Also, the adapter is only capable of 100Mbps speed.  So if you have a decent internet service, mine is Gigabit (1000mbps) you are essentially throttling your connection speed on the Fire Stick by using the LAN adapter.  You might as well go with shaky WiFi if it's faster.  With 100mbps you'll probably experience Picture Quality drops anyway.<br /><br />Seventh, the Alexa remote constantly freezes.  You have to unplug and replug the stick to reset the remotes connection.  That is just unacceptable.<br /><br />One last note, this is the third Fire Stick I've purchased since December 2017.  The first two were from Target and both went back.  The first one stopped working after about a month.  The second stick never worked.  The third stick I bought directly from Amazon, at their suggestion.  It was touch and go the entire time.  I ultimately decided to return that one too.  A warning: if you have a power outage, your Fire Stick will have panic attack.  The remote will become temporarily slower and less responsive (menus and buttons respond slower) and will eventually resolve itself.  The WiFi connection will get slower and weaker.  Nothing resolves this (resetting your router, restarting the Stick), you just have to wait it out.  And if you had it connected to 5G WiFi, forget it.  The Fire Stick seems to be allergic to staying connected to that, especially if there is a power interruption.  My guess is a weak/underpowered WiFi component in the Stick.  Sometimes, even without a power interruption, it will lose the connection, or it will drop to a very weak connection at random.  I have an excellent WiFi connection.  None of my other devices have this problem.  A power loss can also cause the remote to stop working.  So get ready to have to talk to tech support over something that should be a simple fix but isn't.  And then possibly have to exchange your Stick for a replacement, that is if the short 30-day return policy hasn't expired.  So you better hope you don't have any issues with it after one month.  Most companies guarantee their devices for 90 days and have a One-Year Warranty.<br /><br />Like I said, I really wanted to like this product.  Just too many drawbacks.  I ended up shelling out the extra money and getting the latest generation of Apple TV.  It is well worth the extra cash.  The picture quality is much better. The general quality of the apps is better. The Wifi is much stronger.  The remote is nowhere near as primitive as Amazons, in both design and functionality.  The device itself functions much quicker and much more smoothly.  Siri CAN do voice search in every app.  She also understands a lot more, and you can be far less precise and she knows what you want. Also the streaming apps all have the same uniform interface/controls and function the same.  You can switch seamlessly between apps you've been using without it having to reboot them.  Cuts down on time.  Yes, The ATV can't order pizza for you or check showtimes at the movies...oh well...",1,negative,0,0

Currently I have several Apple TV devices as well as several WiFi enabled Blu-Ray players in our home that we were using to stream video. The Fire Stick with Alexa voice remote was so much easier to set up and use that I'm probably going to ditch Apple totally for TV and use them to stream music. I literally had the Fire Stick working in 5 minutes. And as a Prime Member, was immediately streaming TV shows and movies. Apple doesn't support Prime and the Fire Stick supports all of the same ""other"" streaming services as Apple like NetFlix, Hulu, HBO GO etc.. And the Alexa voice support is incredible. Press the button, at the beep, ask Alexa what you want to watch and she finds it and lets you know if it's free (Prime) or something you need to rent or buy. So far, very impressed.",5,positive,0,0

Cable pricing was getting outrageous and I could not justify (no matter how hard I tried)  paying that much money for just a few channels. Sometimes life events happen and budgets need to tighten.  So I purchased a HDMI Digital Antenna for all my local channels and the Fire TV Stick.  I should  have researched more before purchasing the stick.  I use my flat screen TV as my computer monitor (desktop connected via HDMI cable) and I was already streaming Amazon Prime and Netflix.  I was under the impression from reading the description and reviews I would have more options than I already have. I did not. There are very few free apps worth using on the fire stick.  The free TV apps show all the old TV shows and movies I get through my antenna now.  Why would I purchase more TV apps just to flip through channels again.  The few channels I wanted cannot be purchased alone. I life British comedies but needed to purchase the Brit app, I like the Food Channel but need a cable subscription, etc etc.  I also encountered buffering with the fire stick when using my WiFi Ipad at the same time.  This does not happen when I am .using my computer.  To sum it all up, the Fire Stick is not a good value for me.",3,negative,0,0

If you purchase a Roku Streaming Stick this cord is already provided which makes it much easier to manage wires behind the TV and simply the power solution.<br /><br />2)As of July 2018 the Amazon Firestick doesn't offer YouTube TV. I recently got rid of cable and decided to move to YouTube TV which I love but I'm not able to download the YouTube TV app so I had to separately by the Roku Streaming Stick.<br /><br />3)The Amazon Firestick has very loud and clicky buttons that appear to be cheap and a little annoying.

Next you have the ""watch next"" suggestion based on movies that grownups have watched. And it continues, my point is that when my young children turns on the Fire Stick, they are exposed to all kinds of images of movie covers that are not appropriate for their age group before they can navigate to the ""kids"" section.

Although I didn’t use it frequently, it worked well most of the time. As others have said, the need to unplug to fix any oddities gets old quick, but that “fix” had worked for just about everything, until yesterday. I turned on my TV and the screen wouldn’t get past “Amazon” - I googled it to try to find a fix, and the problem seems decently widespread. Tried turning on/off, swapping hdmi ports, changing the outlet, etc.... still got the “amazon” screen and nothing else (I even left it for a few hours, since that worked as a fix for one person). Tried again today, and now I get no signal. Very disappointing to have this product stop working with no clear indication as to what went wrong.",1,negative,0,0

Lots of reviews here about Amazon's great programming which I agree is fantastic! However, I'd like to add a few comments about this product's set-up, use, and service after purchase. First, I'm an old guy and not very technical and the Fire Stick is truly a great plug and play product. So, set-up is extremely easy. Second, the remote provided is very functional and that provides for easy and fast navigation for selecting shows, videos, music, etc. Finally, the biggest selling point for me is Amazon's fantastic customer support. It's outstanding!  One click on their phone app gets you quickly connected to a very knowledgeable technical support team should you have any questions. Hardly, have I ever experienced any significant wait times. I'm usually able to speak with a tech rep within just minutes.",5,positive,0,0

What I enjoyed about the Fire Tv stick was the interface and how its user friendly, and efficient with the apps that you can choose to install. Soon as I bought it, I was very pleased with the navigation and High resolution display it supports.<br /><br />So now...the bad... I purchased this device as of December 2017. By March 2018 I started experiencing issues. Initially the device would just randomly freeze or reboot on its own. Again, I'm a tech guy so I understand that sometimes devices go through those slight glitch moments. By June  I was experiencing the freezing/rebooting at least once a week. Only two apps seemed to be working without problem and that was Netflix and Amazon video. Hulu would not boot up at all and my tv channel apps would stall when I opened them . I reached out to tech support and they suggested a fresh restart (as in from the default settings as if it was new). I completed the restart, after a few stalled hours, and the problems persist. I am now only able to watch netflix on the device. I've never installed more than  6-7 apps on the device at a time. Apparently the warranty is only 3 months because I guess that's when they expect it to crap out or the time someone would install that kodi app  (which I did not) on the device. They offered me a 15% discount to get another one, but why would I want one if it won't last for 6 months with basic apps. Maybe this is one of those you get what you pay for situations.

The Fire TV has a delay / lag anytime a key is press, sometimes. Super annoying.<br />3) Nothing worked the second time. Netflix - I was able to watch it after initial login / install. After that point I could browse movies, but when I went to play there was either a ""network"" issue, or the sound would play without video.

It is a known issue on the internet but for some reason Amazon doesn't seem to think there is. My first one went bad after 6 months, just out of warranty  so Amazon gave me a $10 credit. If you buy this consider the extended warranty for 2 years at $4.99. I bought the warranty when I just purchased this second one in case the issue has not been fixed yet.

I have since learned that with a Roku you can link your Google account and use Google Play and use the Spectrum app to watch tv. Since Spectrum is now requiring digital adapters for each tv, people with the Roku can just use that and not pay for adapters. Can't do either of those with the Fire stick. I bought one for each of the tv's in my house (total of 4). All they are good for is watching whatever is free on Prime and some channels that have free apps.

Very annoying to come home to see your TV on when you know it was off upon leaving.<br /><br />2nd: The remote and delay. I am not sure if this is a lag thing, but I feel it is not. The remote will sometimes work, and sometimes not. It really is annoying when something is playing and you need to pause and it just won't work. Sometimes taking the batteries out and placing them back makes it work, sometimes that doesn't. Sometimes sitting there spamming the buttons will make it work. Sometimes holding the buttons down will make it work. I felt at one point that it might be an internet lag issue, but then why does it happen when something is playing. (Maybe it's an Amazon battery issue? I replaced the Amazon batteries that came with the remote with new Amazon batteries from a pack and still have the same issues *shrug*).<br /><br />3rd: The quasi YouTube functionality. Trash. It will constantly, like every time, need to confirm if I want to open Youtube with Firefox or Sling. Really got old by the third time. Now I have to do that at least once daily.<br /><br />4th: This may not be there fault, but the stupid rewind/forward functionality in the Netflix app. Seriously, why the doesn't it just work like the 10 sec forward and 10 second back function when watching Prime shoes. Like I said, probably Netflix's issue, but still crap.<br /><br />If I didn't need Prime for my business I would have dropped this and returned the stick and never looked back.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because when it works it is okay. It is definitely not a replacement for a tablet and a Google ChromeCast.",2,negative,0,0

When I saw the stick go on sale I decided to buy it.<br />Set-up was easy and straight forward. I was also able to access titles from my watchlist faster and scan trough shows when needed more efficiently.<br /><br />Shortly after my first hour of streaming, my video froze with a partial circle spinning in the center of the screen. When I checked the settings, I found that the Fire stick had lost it's internet connection and was saying I should reboot my router. I did this the first timer and was able to continue watching the video (after about five minutes for the reboot). about thirty minutes later, it happened again. With the same instructions. I once again rebooted my router.<br /> After this reoccurred a third time, I went into the settings and reset the Fire Stick. This had the same affect as the reboot but did not require me to go into another room and wait for the reboot process. It was still a couple of minutes and interupted the experience. This continues to occur at least once per day. after two times i often get disgusted and move on to something else or will just watch it on my laptop.<br />I have the stick connected to the front of my AV receiver to minimize obstructions, amdmy router is less than 25 feet away. I do not have this problem with any other devices. When I stream to my Suface in the kitchen (one floor down and on the other side of the house) i never have an issue. I have even streamed to another laptop in the basement. I have checked twice while streaming to two other devices placed further away, (where i could still monitor them) and when the video from the Fire Stick froze, the other devices kept on playing.<br /><br />As i stated above, it is five stars when it works. Even if it only froze once or twice per week I could begrudgingly give it 3-4, but when it happens every time I use it for more than an hour, I feel two stars is being kind.",2,negative,0,0

The reason I gave it a one star rating is I discovered after purchasing a total of 3 of them (1 and 2 separately) that there is suddenly a limit of 3 that Amazon will sell you without being a business customer. I have additional TVs in my home and my plan was to equip each one with it's own Fire Stick. And yes I know they can be moved from one TV to another but I wanted the convenience of not doing that and in a capitalist country I thought that if I had the money to buy the product Amazon would sell it to me. WRONG. I am a prime member and after nearly an hour on the phone with Amazon customer service and being transferred to 3 reps with my explanation of why I wanted to do something so evil as to buy their product I asked for a supervisor and got Yvonne. I went through my problem for the 4th time as none of them seem to talk to each other and finally after enough asking I got a straight answer that there is a limit of 3 Fire TV sticks. She then tried to talk me into setting up a fake business account to purchase additional ones although I do not own a business. I told her I wasn't going to do that.

There is no way to turn these ads off and when Amazon goes so far as to call you at home while actively refusing to respond to blatant decreases in client experience it just does not make sense.<br /><br />What could make this great are some basic things:<br /><br />1) Since it has it's own power source and internet outlet, linking to google search while the TV is off and bringing results up on the screen would be great.<br />2) The ability to turn the TV on from this so that two remotes are not needed would be good.<br />3) Voice searchable youtube is critical, since 70% of content is available there about most topics for free.<br />4) Easier app searching would be good.",1,negative,0,0

I have a roku as a well (which was more expensive) and I even consider this an upgrade. At first I was sad that I wasn't able to use the voice control in applications like Netflix but the controller was very responsive and works very well in conjunction with amazon prime. The only reason I am giving this a 3-Star is because after only 2 months my controller stopped working. I have tried new batteries and it has not been abused so I am unsure of the issue. I have tried using their remote app on my GS8 phone however the app does  disconnects randomly and sometimes I have to uninstall and reinstall to get it to connect. I noticed the app worked a lot better on my girlfriends older phone so it may just not be programmed well for the newer phones yet. So without a working controller it makes it a pretty hard device to use but when it used to work it was nice.,2,negative,0,0

UI looks like a giant ad.,"I've had some version of Apple TV for at least 5 years and when they added the voice button in the Gen 4 I was super excited thinking I was finally going just be able to tell Siri what I wanted to happen on the TV ""Siri: Open Netflix, pause, resume, search for 'X'"" etc. Alas, that's still not possible and with my self-proclaimed luddite mother about to be watching my 2 year old regularly I wanted a TV that could take voice commands that I could just write down for her. Enter: Fire TV Stick with Alexa.<br /><br />Now this actually wasn't the first Alexa enabled device I've purchased. I purchased an Echo Tap for my wife's birthday a few months earlier and we just use it like a regular Echo by leaving it in ""hands free mode"" and constantly plugged into the wall, but we COULD take it on the go if we wanted. The Alexa I had come to know through that device more than capably handled interfacing with every member of the family, managing my music and playing it back through a (surprisingly) nice compact speaker. Not so with the Fire Stick.<br /><br />First complaint: No Youtube App. I got this just as the whole Google/Amazon drama was coming to a head and wasn't super versed in the situation at the time I placed the order. As a parent of a small child who can only be immobilized by certain youtube videos in emergencies, when I got it out of the box and saw that it no longer had the Youtube app and they had instead replaced it with a shortcut to the desktop version of the site I almost sent it back right then and there. With my wife's first day back at work after having our son fast approaching I decided to keep trying despite this massive deficiency right out of the box.<br /><br />Second complaint: No ""hands free mode"". You must push the button on the remote to talk to Alexa. Now, to be fair, I knew this going in, but I also knew that you could use a Dot or other Echo device to control the Firestick if you set it up right. This is maybe 20% accurate. Yes, there are settings on all the devices I've mentioned that should allow Alex to take commands from any speaker and run them on any connected, Alexa-enabled device, but ultimately the Fire Stick controls were SEVERLY lacking. The syntax needed was far too specific, there were few if any skills available for our most-used app applications... basically, it technically worked, but it never really ""worked"".<br /><br />Third and final complaint: The advertising. In an age where every TV comes with Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, and Amazon Prime Video apps pre-installed out of the box why in god's name should I spend $50 extra dollars on an additional piece of equipment (no matter how small) to access all of those COMMERCIAL FREE services over a device that has so many ads built into the UI it's hard to tell what's an app and what's an ad that's going to launch you down a rabbit hole of product advertisements. The whole interface was just so overwhelmingly littered with banners and unsolicited trailers and advertisements that I dreaded returning to the home menu for anything. This was truly what broke the camel's back for me.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Fire Stick is only going to satisfy a small subset of people who meet one or more of the following criteria: 1.) don't have a smart enough TV to run streaming apps natively 2.) Hate Apple and/or don't have the money to spend on a new Apple TV 3.) Have accepted that our world was turned into a capitalist hellscape long ago and have had the part of their brain irritated by a constant barrage of advertising callused over permanently. 4.)

B00ZV9RDKK,"on August 1, 2018",amzn1.account.AEVCCBLL5SXTQTTPT7WKML7UV7OA,Great for six weeks...now I'm throwing them out,"We received a couple of these as a Christmas gift, but didn't start using them until we moved in April. At first we loved them. Our cable bill was cut in half and we were able to access all of our favorite channels with Hulu live TV, plus all of the Prime content, and a few other apps. Then, after about six weeks, things stopped working. We had the most trouble accessing Hulu, so we contacted their support team and they told us Amazon had done an update to their software and now several Hulu customers were having trouble connecting. They said they were working on a patch and credited us for a month while they it got worked out. We looked online and learned that this was a common problem. We decided to stick it out because we had been SO happy with it up to that point, and I come from the tech industry, so I know these things sometimes do happen with updates, but I felt that a bug fix would get it taken care of pretty quickly.<br /><br />By the time we got to the end of our one month credit, we were able to access Hulu, but not without trying 2-3 times each time we tried to launch the app, and when it finally did open it would only partially load (we could see the text of the menu, but not images). We also often experienced a connection failure while we were watching something.<br /><br />Since we were having trouble with Hulu, we began trying the other apps more, and we noticed that our other apps were having just as much trouble. We even had trouble accessing Prime content.<br /><br />When watching Prime content, we would sometimes get an error stating that our internet speed did not support streaming, even though we have the fastest speed available, and we live in the L.A. area, so it's not like we're using countryside infrastructure. That made us think we were being throttled but our ISP, but speed tests never showed this and their customer service assured me that there was no throttling with the service package we had purchased (if you can trust ISPs).<br /><br />We kept troubleshooting and the kicker came when we had successfully logged into Hulu on the Fire Stick one morning (after two attempts), and we were trying to watch a show. While the status bar was going across on the TV, waiting for the show to start, my husband was able to search for and download the Hulu app on his phone, log into our account, set his mobile app preferences, then launch the show and start watching it, all before the Fire Stick even started playing the program. Both devices were using the same internet at the same time. The Fire Stick action had been started first and we did not even pick up the phone until after the Fire Stick had already been showing us the status bar for a couple of minutes.<br /><br />The next day we bought a Roku stick for one TV, and we cannot believe how much easier life has gotten on that TV. We turn it on and it works. The menus automatically load, right away, WITH all of the images. We hit the Hulu button and the app launches within seconds. We have zero delay in anything. And the Roku remote also turns the TV on and off, plus controls the volume, so we don't have to fumble with two remotes. The Fire Stick issues have still not been resolved, so we just ordered another Roku stick for the bedroom today.<br /><br />I love Amazon and I was excited to get my Fire Sticks, but after only three months of using them, I guess I am going to throw them in a box. I can't even give them to anyone knowing all of the problems they have. I feel guilty having asked my mother-in-law to buy us these for Christmas. She wasted her money.",1,negative,0,0

Well, three months later they charged me $104 and some change for not returning the dead one. Yes, $104 for the remote that sells for $30 brand new. I was neither asked to return it nor was there a link to print a return label anywhere in the order info page, so I sent the dead one off to electronics recycling. I eventually got it straightened out with Amazon, but it was a hassle. Of course, the remote problem wouldn't bear mentioning were it not for the fact that the Fire TV stick itself just doesn't work that well.<br /><br />Video periodically stutters or pauses in a number of different apps. The Google Internet Speed Test shows there's no lack of bandwidth here, so it isn't the internet connection. The problems got significantly worse after the June Fire TV system update. NBC News makes it about ten minutes into a full episode before the video starts skipping until it becomes unwatchable. HBO NOW initially worked well enough, but since the June update pauses for several seconds every minute or so. This only happens on the Fire TV, but not when watching on other devices in the house such as my laptop or phone. I go into the settings to clear the app cache and then restart the device several times a day. This sometimes helps a bit. Also, periodically the Fire stick freaks out and repeats the last remote navigation button press indefinitely. Pulling the remote's batteries does nothing to stop the keypresses, so it's over to the tv to unplug the power adapter.<br /><br />The whole point of a home entertainment device seems lost if one has to spend an inordinate amount of time trying to make it work as intended. I fear this Fire TV stick has a rendezvous with the electronics recyclers in the near future.",1,negative,0,0

It should be super nice to be able to link the TV Stick to your Echo and control shows with your voice without even having to touch the remote... but it always takes Amazon 5 seconds to forward your commands to the Fire Stick, even if they're in the same room, and Alexa usually can't understand my voice while the TV is going.<br /><br />The centralized search feature should make it easy to find shows and movies in all of your streaming services at the same time. On my smart TV I'd have to search Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu all separately. Unfortunately, half of the time you'll get some stupid error like ""sorry, I can't search for science fiction"".<br /><br />Alexa voice control is very buggy. It frequently fails to open apps, either giving a generic error or claiming the Fire Stick is offline. Sometimes Alexa opens the wrong show, or just doesn't respond to your commands at all.<br /><br />You have to dig deep into the menu to find the command to put the Fire Stick to sleep, and of course you can't do this with voice commands.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I bought this at the same time. Setup went fine for me, but with my girlfriend's Fire TV Stick setup was a huge hassle. She plugged it in, spent 20 minutes installing apps and linking her accounts, and then we realized that half the features didn't work because it couldn't connect to Amazon's servers. So we spent 30 minutes installing a software update, which didn't fix the issue, then had to spend another 30 minutes doing a factory reset, then another 20 minutes installing apps and linking accounts again. At least it worked properly after all that, but nobody should have to factory reset the device right after receiving it just to get it to work.<br /><br />The CEC on my Fire TV Stick doesn't work. I can control other HDMI devices (such as my Blu-ray player) using my TV remote with CEC, but the TV will not detect the Fire TV Stick even though CEC is turned on at both ends.

Voice controls are far superior to the Roku and you can control it from the remote or another Alexa device<br />2. Comes with a HDMI extension if it doesn't fit straight in the hdmi port (It also said this small cord will boost wifi)<br />3. It has beautiful photos for a screensaver<br />4. It has good image quality most of the time<br />5. It has a way better way amazon prime interface than the roku<br />6. It still has Viki Asian drama channel (which has been removed from the Roku for some reason)<br />7. It has a web browser which i probably won't use except for youtube.<br />8. I got it a lot cheaper than the Roku stick<br />9. There's parental controls that can be set require a pin to buy videos/apps and/or open apps.<br />10. it has games which may be nice for some people<br />11. It felt like an easy setup to me and I didn't need to look at the instructions.<br />12. The interface looks attractive (This does not mean I like the interface just it's looks)<br /><br />Now is time for the bad<br />1. The interface is horrible! Nothing stays the same so you have to hunt for the app you need unless you always open all apps.<br />2. There are a lot of ads throughout the experience (Roku's ads are not intrusive like these are)<br />3. Random apps have popped up in my app's and channels section (I hate ESPN Amazon!)<br />4. No google apps at all so if you or your kids like YouTube or YouTube kids this is a bad choice (you can use the browser app to view youtube but it is really slow and doesn't have the kids version)<br />5. There are a lot less apps than Roku so I would see if the channels you want are available (They don't have my cable company's apps, Vudu, and a few others that I would miss if I didn't have a Roku in the front room. Although movies anywhere fixes some of the problem apps)<br />6.The remote doesn't have a dedicated Netflix and hulu buttons... Or even better i should have four customizable buttons that I could choose which apps I could open.<br />7. While the quality is nice and crisp most of the time I have had random slowdowns or quality drops every once in a while. Roku doesn't seem to have this problem and the fire is right next to the wifi. I also don't have internet that gets throttled so I don't know what would be causing it I may just get the optional Ethernet adapter if I notice it too much since the router is next to my TV.<br />8. There is no TV controls on this remote! I didn't realize how nice the Roku remote was until I got this as I can't change my tv's volume or turn it off and on. Regretfully I will need two remotes to watch tv in my bedroom.<br />9. It's a lot slower than the Roku (Apps just pop up quickly on Roku while these fade in and out)<br />10. When you close a app it doesn't keep it in the memory that long so you can't always reopen an app and return to the movie you were watching if you accidentally press the home button<br />11. The Plex app doesn't seem as polished as the Roku version.<br /><br />And I'm not sure if I like or hate the fire TV iOS app yet. It makes it a lot easier to find apps but it's really easy to scroll to fast. I Think the Roku app is better but that doesn't make this app bad.

We bought two during Black Friday. Then we bought a new modem/router thinking it was just as getting old, but it turns out the FireTVsticks loose WiFi frequently. We had to buy the adapter and wire the living room tv with a Ethernet cord to solve the problem. The upstairs tv is on the other side of a regular wall from the modem/router, and it loses connection frequently. Be prepared to buy the adapter and Ethernet cord. With that said I just bought a third one because who wants to deal with all different tv systems in one house and since we have already invested the time mastering the WiFi problem, it’s an okay deal when you can pick it up for $24.99.",3,negative,0,0

But falls far short of the Roku streaming stick.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The Fire TV Stick remote control is sleek and responsive.  When you push one of the buttons, you really feel it distinctly and know the system will respond accordingly.<br />There are web browsers that Roku doesn’t offer so you can surf the web using your TV.<br />You can shop through the Fire TV Stick’s native Amazon store app.<br />The remote has voice control with Alexa.<br />The price is right.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The menus are convoluted and slow to navigate. Unlike the Roku’s default main screen, which shows 9-12 apps so the user can quickly find what they’re looking for, the Fire TV Stick’s cluttered main menu shows only a few apps sandwiched between several rows of recommended movies, TV shows, etc.  So if you know you’re looking for the MLB app, for example, you must navigate to a secondary menu and scroll.<br />There is no dedicated YouTube app... at least not from YouTube.  Instead, with the Fire TV Stick, you must use a web browser to navigate to YouTube, or use a hokey app that looks like it was put together by amateurs.<br />The Fire TV Stick also seems to be slower than the Roku stick.<br />The voice control is clunky and isn’t as intuitive as using Alexa on an Echo device.<br /><br />Overall, the Fire TV Stick is a decent streaming device.

I have a Samsung Smart TV that was probably manufactured in 2013 or early 2014 and it takes forever to connect to the internet and accessing Netflix and HULU on it has now become a joke. The Fire TV Stick is automatically connected to the internet and is so fast. The quality of picture is absolutely stunning and I have access to so many other Streaming services. I know people post on here in the reviews ""whats the point of getting this if you have a smart TV already or an Xbox or playstation..."" Its because the stick is so much better than those other devices sometimes! My boyfriends Xbox one is nice, but I definitely prefer the ease of control with the remote of the Fire Stick or being able to use Alexa to control my streaming. The Xbox controller is so confusing for the controls sometimes. I don't know much about playstation. But I would definitely recommend the Fire TV Stick to anyone!!! The only thing that sucks is if you want to control your TV volume or turn your TV on with the Fire Stick, your TV has to be HDMI CEC compatible or you have to buy a separate attachment not made by amazon to turn on your TV through your Fir Stick remote. I said this already with my Amazon Echo review, but there should be an info red attachment you can plug into your Echo or Amazon should come out with a remote that can connect your other devices. The Hubs that allow you to do this are way to expensive if you only want to control two things.",5,positive,0,0

Received the box, took it out, and read the instructions on how to open the stick to insert the batteries (normally, this process is just an intuitive process but the under body of the stick is solid with no apparent ""battery compartment"").  It said to use both thumbs on each side of the bottom of the stick and push up to remove the whole underbody to insert the batteries.  No go!  I had to get a kitchen knife and force the blade into the extremely tight crease at the bottom of the stick and push down and sideways to get it to open.  I knew then that I was in trouble if the design of the stick was so stupid just to get to the battery compartment.  They should hand these sticks out at their corporate marketing meetings and tell the executives that they are going to lose $1,000.00 of their salary for each minute that passes while they try to get the stupid thing open to put the batteries in.  My Roku has a separate little battery compartment which works just great.  Then, onward to hooking this thing up and testing it out.  Seemed to work fine for about 10 minutes and then froze up.  None of the buttons would make anything happen on the menu.  Unplugged it from the HDMI port and let it hang in air for about 20 minutes and tried it again.  Same thing happened.  I unplugged and re-plugged power and it worked again.  I have bought thousands of dollars of Amazon products and enjoy Prime but this thing is apparently left to be bought by customers when there are obvious known problems with design and with engineering.  My Roku Express just works (as this device should).

I was kinda tricked by cs but that's irrelevant. We already have a ""stick"" kit by another company in use at home. But I figured since this had a voice remote this might be better.<br /><br />I AM HAVING SO MUCH TROUBLE WITH THIS.<br /><br />First off, it's not really clear whether the apps are downloaded or not in your menu. It was hard to keep track of whether I just owned an app or it was actually downloaded. There is a setting to remove just owned apps from the main menu.<br /><br />For example: Netflix was on the main menu so I clicked on it. I had owned it but it wasn't downloaded on the device. I didn't know that at the time because it said nothing about downloading. It was just confusing. Once I figured out how to download it it gets stuck installing.<br /><br />I successfully downloaded other apps but there were like 3 apps that I attempted to download many times. They just say installing forever and eventually say they are unable to download. There is enough space on the device and I reset the router 2 times. I also used the extension for the HDMI which apparently gives the wifi more strength. I still to this day can't download the number one app we use. We ended up switching back to our other ""stick"" device. And I'm really disappointed because I found the voice remote to be very helpful. I also liked all the setting options in the fire stick! But it's ALL useless if I cant access the apps I want.<br /><br />I'll pull it out another time eventually when I want to set it up again. I'll probably reset it and start again but for now it's just collecting dust. I unfortunately can't send it back for a refund or exchange... That's how the promo credits work lol. I might contact support at some point to get this fixed but I really doubt they will know what's wrong. They'll probably say it's my internet connection but if it is all I can say is our other device works fine with our internet connection. I wonder if anyone else is having this problem.

They're sending me a new one, but they're off to a terrible start.<br /><br />Update: I received one of the additional Fire Sticks I ordered, and it did the same thing as the first one on my TV; when it powered on, I could see the white Amazon logo on my screen for a few seconds, then the screen would go black, and nothing else would happen. I tried different inputs on the TV, etc., but nothing would make it work. Then, I decided to try to connect it via an HDMI splitter, to see if that remedied the issue, and voila! So, I had to use an HDMI splitter to make it work with my TV, which should be a deal breaker considering the cost, but because I have a dozen of them laying around the house, it was an acceptable solution for me. I then set everything up, and noticed a few annoying things, the most annoying of which was that the YouTube app isn't really an app; you have to go through a browser app to access it (either Firefox or some other I'd never heard of). OK, so YouTube is basically a non-starter on this thing. Considering I have a paid subscription to YouTube TV (including YouTube Red, YouTube Music, You Tube Kids, etc.), I was pretty let down by that. I then went to Netflix, and started watching WWII in color. Everything seemed great for about 5 minutes, when the program paused itself. I looked at the remote, and it was nowhere where anything could've bumped it, but I figured it was just a streaming hiccup (even though I'm running 300+ Mbps over Wi-Fi). But, frustratingly, when I pressed the play button to continue the program, it lost the audio. I had to turn the TV off and then back on for the audio to kick back in. Over the next hour, the Fire Stick continued this pattern of pausing itself and losing audio about every 2-5 minutes.<br /><br />That's 2+ strikes for the Fire Stick. Granted I only paid $20 each for them on Prime Day, but with these severe shortcomings, I wouldn't use them if they were free.",1,negative,0,0
B00ZV9RDKK,"on July 2, 2018",amzn1.account.AGWWSXSBDJDISRDKLY7N2PLFUNZQ,Our Fire TV Stick seemed like an awesome device after we first began using it,"Our Fire TV Stick seemed like an awesome device after we first began using it. We received it as a gift and liked it a lot initially. However, it started crashing, slowly at first and then got progressively worse as we used it. When we contacted Amazon technical support, they kept telling us to re-start  it, re-set it to factory settings, clear all the data, and de-register the device. Nothing helped. They then refused to replace the device or send us a full refund because it was no longer under warranty. I really wish I had pushed for a refund them when we first started experiencing the problem.<br /><br />We have had multiple streaming devices over the past decade (e.g., an Apple TV, a Roku Player, streaming capabilities through a DVD player) and none of these gave us as much difficulty as the Amazon Fire TV Stick even though they all supposedly used inferior, out-dated technology. I strongly discourage anyone from purchasing this product. After reading the reviews, we have decided to switch to the Roku streaming stick. According to those reviews, others who experienced similar problems with the Fire TV stick ended up purchasing a Roku streaming stick and the problem was resolved.",1,negative,0,0

On the lowest volume setting above mute (1/100), the sound was tolerable if a bit quiet. On the next setting up (2/100) the audio was very loud and distorted. To be fair, our Android phones do the same thing, and we solve it by turning the volume down on the phone - how that works over HDMI is a bit of a mystery to me. Laptops and another media player ignore any local volume settings, and the TV controls it all with no issues.<br /><br />But another big thing for me here was how to just get it so it would turn on, and stop playing previews and trailers at me. Our current media player supports Netflix but not Prime, so I was looking forward to a smooth experience, and that's not what I got.<br /><br />On the plus side, in trying to address the audio issues, we tried several apps. The process of installing them is painless, though the selection is limited, and some of them, notably those claiming to be able to control the system volume, were mostly non-functional.",3,negative,0,0

B00ZV9RDKK,"on August 3, 2018",amzn1.account.AE4KRU3AHQYUTYIEQU6FCC5DHMDQ,Disappointing,I have a Roku stick and wanted to try the Fire Stick in my other tv - basically so that I could test out which one would be easier for my dad to use since I am hooking him up with the whole streaming thing as a xmas present.<br /><br />Anyways - I plugged everything in - it was quite easy :)  The set up was pretty easy to get thru as well.<br /><br />But I can't get my hulu account from this stick.  Hulu downloaded and when I went to log in - I couldn't get a keyboard to put in my password information - so I went back to Amazon and clicked thru hulu app for my Fire stick and it said it wasn't supported with that fire stick ........<br /><br />I also find the Fire Stick to be WAY slower to get things to come up then the Roku.  I almost feel like I am sitting there thinking did I press the button?  And the Alexa thing .....I can do without .....I did try it out to see if it would make things easier or faster and it did not.<br /><br />The menu was obviously a different format then Roku but I do find that it was easy to flip thru just very SLOW.  I have<br />decided that it is fine for my bedroom tv.  (I cut the cord to cable)  As it doesn't really get used much.  But will be going Roku from here on out.<br /><br />I am glad that I had both sticks so that I could make a comparison.  Both sticks were approximately the same pricing so I figure they should be similar enough to make a comparison.  I think if I were able to get Hulu to work I might have been able to get used to the slowness - but since that is one of the main one I stream it just seems like a waste.,1,negative,0,0

It helped me to cut the cable cord, thus saving me a lot of money.  With this Fire TV Stick, I then subscribed to Netflix, Hulu, and Playstation Vue for many local channels.  I loved the voice remote, as it helped me to find something specific I may be looking for, without having to search around on my screen.  It was also very easy to connect to my TV and my internet.<br /><br />One downside to this product is that there is a learning curve for sure.  On a Roku, there are buttons right on the remote for Netflix, Hulu, Sling, and Playstation Vue to jump right to those apps.  On the Fire Stick there isn't one, so you just have to scroll around and then click on it.  No big deal, but it's just more cumbersome.  When I have guests visit the house, they have a hard time maneuvering with this thing and need a lot of help from me, unlike the Roku which is more straightforward.<br /><br />While the above wasn't too big of a deal, I did end up having to switch to a Roku.  After lots and lots of buffering issues with Playstation Vue and the Firestick (spending a lot of time with Playstation Vue's helpdesk and working all the troubleshooting ideas they had -- such as clearing cache and force quitting the app -- which worked temporarily but got to be a daily thing....they said this is a common issue with Firesticks), I had to switch to the Roku.  I have no buffering issues now.  This issue very well could be on Playstation Vue's end and not necessarily with the Firestick, but the end result is that I can't watch my favorite app using a Firestick without the buffering.  And, with the easier remote of the Roku, it's working well for me.<br /><br />All in all, it's a good product....it just didn't work for me unfortunately.",3,negative,0,0

Looking forward to streaming and enjoying movies and tv. I have several devices that can do this but these stivks will let me consoladate apps in one place. Other devices are preloaded. I have combination of wired and wireless connections with 400mb speed from spectrum (used to be time Warner). I usually opt for wired as it is more consistent.<br />Have been streaming and not at all pleased with quality. SD isnt that bad but anything high def is blotchy and always buffering. Testing speed I am getting anywhere from 15 to 55 MB with wired and 8 to 26 with Wi-Fi. This still should be ok as most sources suggest 10 MB can get hd and amazon says 2.5 Will get hd. However fire stick isn't. Customer support suggests that my internet speed needs to be upgraded and/or I have too many devices connected and need to walk around house disconnecting stuff if I want to watch with fire stick. I asked how that would matter since other devices arent suffering from loss anywhere close to that. Support stated that they have people that call with these same issues and Only have 6 devices connected to internet. I asked how the fire stick could possibly be geared towards households where the expectation is there would be less than 6 connected devices and have internet speeds more than 400 MB as I only know 1 family personally that has less than 6 devices (they have 3) and no family with more than 400 MB download speed.<br />In any event, not Happy with something and that something is the fire stick.",2,negative,0,0

The sticks were easy to set up.  We have signed up for Hulu so we could get the channels we liked plus the local channels.  We also signed up for HBO and Starz.  We had to upgrade our router and internet, but even with those additional expenses and the cost of our subscriptions, we are paying less than half what we were paying DirecTV for a lot of channels we don't watch and now we're getting more options.  We do miss the DirecTV guide so we could see better what was coming on.  Having to go thru the different channels or apps is a bit of a pain, but it's well worth the cost savings.  The recording option is limited to 50 hours.  If you record a lot (like my parents who record EVERYTHING), this might not be for you.  Also, if you're internet is not strong, don't bother getting these sticks.  I don't miss DirecTV dropping everytime we get a bad storm (I'm in tornado alley - we get thunderstorms all the time).  I will not miss the DirecTV boxes and all the wires.  I love the Alexa voice remote capability.  Now we just need to get a bigger TV for the living room and move the current TV to the bedroom and replace the one with the bad HDMI plugs.  I do wish there were other options for connecting the sticks to the TV so that they weren't dependent on the HDMI ports.",5,positive,0,0

Not perfectly but not with major flaws.  In it's 3rd month of operation, streaming stuff from Prime Video itself has it pausing consistently.  Shows or movies will pause all the time but not really more than once per show/movie.  Still it is a bit frustrating.  A fix I read about was to clear the data or cache for the app, which didn't fix it at all.  This was also a recommended fix that worked for other apps available to fire tv.  Perhaps it's a problem with the latest update of the device, which was a couple of weeks ago and seemingly around the time that the playback problem began.  That would hopefully mean this glitch will only be temporary and it's not a defect in the device itself.<br /><br />Couple of other criticisms.  I did not like the remote it comes with as it feels very flimsy and I expect that it will break with regular use much faster than other remotes.  The buttons are very stiff which adds to my fear of it wearing down quickly.  This isn't fact yet just the way I feel about the build of the remote.  I do not like that it will not power down and only go into sleep mode.  I suppose I could unplug it to completely power down but that can be more difficult than expected depending on how your device is hooked up.<br /><br />I do still like the device and will probably get more fire tv devices, perhaps not another stick though just because my experience in this short time hasn't been very satisfactory.

I have 125 Mbps fiber internet and the Fire Stick constantly loses network connection. (My Fire Stick is 10 feet from my router with no obstructions.) I constantly have to reboot the Fire Stick to regain the dropped network connection. When it is connected, the streaming is slow and constantly buffering. Amazon sells add on equipment to connect directly via EtherNet, but I don't want to buy more equipment nor have another wire.<br /><br />To utilize Alexa with the Fire Stick, you have to press the mic button on the severely limited remote. If I have to pick up the remote for Alexa, why not just use the remote. Alexa will not control through echo devices.<br /><br />The free content available on Amazon Prime Video is very outdated and limited. Have a look at Amazon Prime Video on your computer to see the available content. People are stating claims of money savings by using subscription based apps on the Fire Stick, but any modern smart TV will run most of, if not all, those apps. The YouTube app has been removed and now you have to use the browser to access YouTube. (The browser itself is an additional download that isn't easy to accomplish) Searching for content is cumbersome and frustrating. You will need to be somewhat technically savvy to do anything beyond browse suggested content.<br /><br />I dislike the cable company just as much as the next guy but the Fire Stick has a long way to go before it's the way to go. If you're going to be using Fire Stick as part of your cable cutting process, get ready to watch a bunch of YouTube videos on how to fully utilize the device. Amazons suggested troubleshooting is basically turn it off and back on, or restore to factory settings.<br /><br />Before purchasing a Fire Stick I suggest:<br />Checking out Amazon Prime Video online to see what free content is available.<br />Checking the cost of the subscription services such as HBO, Sling, Netflix, etc.<br />Verify what apps could be used on a regular smart TV without Fire Stick",2,negative,0,0

I have an older Firestick version that works fine on my TV, just now painfully slow so thought I'd buy an upgrade.  The newer version with the Alexa Voice Remote, according to the snarky tech support guy, said my TV is not compatible with the new version. Seems like a very stupid flaw in the design since most newer TV models are Smart TV's and have no need for a Firestick. But nevertheless, if you have a Sony TV I would save the headache of trying to get it to work (no sound) - Seems like they should know upfront that it doesn't work on certain TV's unless they just decided it's easier to blame it on the TV and not their product. Don't get me started on the attitude of the tech support (3rd guy - not the first two) -honestly I'm the customer who has spent half her life trying to get their inadequate product to work on my perfectly fine TV - they should have it on the product page that it doesn't work with Sony TV's",1,negative,0,0

My first one is about 2 years old. This one is noticeably more responsive. It's just quicker navigating and starting shows than the first generation model.<br /><br />It's also noticeably larger. It's still easy to tuck behind the TV out of sight. But it is larger than the original.<br /><br />It did come preloaded with my account info. I plugged it in and it was ready to go. No signing in required other than my Wifi password. The system did ask me if I wanted Amazon to store my Wifi and other passwords on Amazon's servers so if I ever got another FireStick it would have all that info preloaded and just work out of the box. Um...how about 'no, Amazon. You cannot store my passwords.<br /><br />The downside of it over the original is that for some reason the CES remote function (where you can use the TV's remote control to work the FireStick rather than the FireStick remote) doesn't bring the FireStick out of sleep mode. It works for everything else, but once in sleep mode you have to use the FireStick remote to wake it up. And for some inane reason there is no place in settings to change the sleep timer from 20 minutes to any other value (like never). You can adjust the timer on the screen saver, but not the full sleep mode. It's 20  minutes out of the box with no direct way to change it.<br /><br />There are ways to change it using ADB, and I can confirm they work. (Do a web search for it if you don't know)  But that's dumb to have to do that. Just let the CES remote function wake the unit from sleep. My first generation FireStick doesn't have this problem. I don't want to use the FireStick remote. I want to use my remote. Don't make me have to use your remote for the 1 function of waking the system.",4,positive,0,0

Worked a lot better went from Fair signal to now I am now getting Very Good signal. This lasted for about 3 days, now I am getting more buffering than when I had the router upstairs. It must be the device itself. I tried Netflix streaming directly from my tv app instead of through the firestick and no buffering. As soon as I switch back to the firestick after a few hours the buffering starts again. Tried streaming with VUDU and same thing constant buffer issues. Tried to force stop and clear cache, clear data. It seems to work for a little while then the next day starts buffering again. If this is what i have to do to get it to work without buffering, what a pain. Seems I will have to purchase the Ethernet adapter to make it hard wired in order for it to work as advertised.

I have an old Apple TV that does not support the Prime Video app, so I decided to give Fire Stick a try rather than purchase a newer model ATV. The device works flawlessly as far as installing, setting up and using it. I expected Alexa to have far more capabilities than it does. The Spotify app is borderline useless, there are no radio stations and the playlists are sorta there, but strung out in this weird linear format that is pretty useless. The Spotify app may as well not even exist unless if you have any sort of specific music tastes. The Netflix app is kinda ok, but your voice command is limited to opening the Netflix app, you get to use the remote for everything else. The remote does not stand by and wait for voice commands, you have to pick it up to trigger Alexa, which kind of defeats having Alexa to begin with. Prime Video plays from the device, which does beat mirroring it from my phone, but the app is clunky and so far does not appear to respond to voice commands once the app is open and playing a selection. Maybe my expectations were too high to begin with, but it seems like apps were thrown together and not the priority of any of the developers. As someone who works in the software industry, I can totally understand that. For the price point, I guess it’s ok, but it did not replace the iPad playing Spotify or the ATV for netflix. Hopefully these apps will become more robust with time.",3,negative,0,0

And that's mostly only because the Chromecast has no remote, which some consider an advantage.<br /><br />The remote for the Fire TV Stick is decent, although it has no volume buttons for my TV, unlike the others.  I like it better than the Roku remote, but the remote is the worst problem with Roku's. I'm not a fan of voice commands and Alexa is no different from others in it's wonky behavior. I asked it to change the channel last night, but it instead sent me to the Home screen, where an ironic advert was boasting about this very capability. Voice command technology has been at this point for over 20 years now, so I'm not sure why it's suddenly considered cute.<br /><br />However, the main problem with the Fire TV Stick is the interface.  There is no organization, so it's really difficult to find specific programming.  It just seems like Amazon is trying to sell you stuff, rather than offering the service you paid to receive.

I'm rebooting it but very close to just returning it and getting another Chromecast.. I hate that I'm paying for prime and can't enjoy the benefits. It may be time to ditch it altogether for Google Express.<br /><br />Chromecast is so much better. We had two Chromecasts but I was annoyed because I had Amazon Prime and couldn't watch any of those movies, so we got this. We planned to use it for our projector, which we move between the playroom, living room, and patio. We had to swap it out for one of the Chromecasts because any slight touch (I unplugged my phone charger from the shared surge protector) and it cuts out and reboots. We swapped it for the Chromecast and no more trouble. Then we put it on the living room TV, as nothing should be bumping it back there and turning it off. Now we're dealing with the issue that it can't control the TV like Chromecast did. I just want to be able to adjust the volume. This sucks. Maybe it'd work better alongside an echo or something but I'm not investing anymore into Amazon devices.",1,negative,0,0

We have high speed interenet with Comcast and wifi works great on everything....but the Fire TV stick has had to  be reboote several times.  When we are in the middle of watching something, it often buffers on us and we get really frustrated!!!  Our Roku died so we tried this as everything we buy from Amazon is usually great.  When it works it's great.  Love the Alexa voice remote.  Comes up with all kinds of things when you ask it!

B00ZV9RDKK,"on July 18, 2018",amzn1.account.AG4VFFIAEACEVWAU5BQHHEJLT6PQ,Amazon doesn't care if the Fire Stick doesn't work with the advertised channels.,"Bought several of these at the beginning of the year and was happy to cancel the cable subscription.  Worked great for the first few months although it took a little time to remember where the shows were we wanted to watch.  But, once Amazon announced the Cube was coming out, all of a sudden we started having huge issues getting into paid channels, especially HULU!  I've spent several hours on the phone with both parties.  Amazon was not helpful at all.  They admitted there is a problem on their end, but have no idea when it will be resolved.  HULU, however, at least tried to troubleshoot the issue though it didn't work.  Amazon told me that I could return the fire sticks and that they would issue me advance credit to enable me to buy another media player, but the credit never appeared and the return labels they said they sent to my email address also never appeared.  I've since spoken with several people who tell me they have experienced the same issue.  Seemed to coincide with release of Cube.  Hmmmmm.... I'm not sure it's worth another 5 hours to get Amazon to honor their promise in the return.  Very frustrating.",2,negative,0,0

B00ZV9RDKK,"on July 5, 2018",amzn1.account.AHLOGBXN2JKZEENW45RFJZ2PR5EQ,"Great steaming device, but missing a few things...","The device is actually really good. Turns your TV into a smart TV, and has a really good browser. The voice activation is awesome and responsive. Then why only 3 stars? The fact that it is missing YouTube really hurts  this device. They do have a workaround by going through the browser, but it's not as fluid as a dedicated app. This in my opinion keeps it from really beating the xompitition. The only other minor issue, is the remote can not control volume. So you have to keep the TV remote handy. It would be nice if they added some universal remote functions to this. They do sell an add on universal remote that clicks on, but that makes the device clunky.<br />Other than those things it's a great streaming stick and way better than Chrome cast.<br />One last thing, if your using this for kodi you may have some sound issues....",3,negative,0,0

B00ZV9RDKK,"on July 8, 2018",amzn1.account.AFSYUZL7UJM4OUPKJB37OTM3EIIQ,Cannot connect to Internet,"Let me start with Amazon is great and usually provides quality products. However, this device is the worst. My device is placed within 4 feet of my router (100+mbps) and it loses WiFi within 15-20 minutes without fail. All the tech service had to say was “did you reset your device?” The Internet service setting states that the signal strength is “very good”and yet it does not connect. It has become rather routine to reset it every 20 minutes, and as a result, I try to avoid using this device as much as possible. I opt to use my laptop plugged into an hdmi adapter and get up to change my video or pause the video rather than use the fire stick. Although there are some perks... every time I reset this device, I have the quality time to reflect on how I wish I hadn’t purchased this device. Best of luck",1,negative,0,0
